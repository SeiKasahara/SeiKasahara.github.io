# Submachine Universe译稿4


# Subhistory Theory
# Sub历史理论

by:MrEMan

One day I'll tell you about the early builds of the submachine, that took place in -1900 -1906 in Kent. the first submachine was built in early 1900. that much we know. ancient location was built later using a time machine. sub0 I am to say this. ;). it was made long after the first submachine. From the builders point of view, naturally, what other point of view can we take?... historical? with the time machine a historical point of view doesn`t exist any more... Referring to to the statue in Ancient sections of sub4 that could be the real looking of mur take it more symbolical. Someone triggered spontaneous creation of submachines. After the invention sub started to expand by itself.so there was a human factor in it at the beginning. but no more. So here we go.

我将告诉你关于Submachine建造的早期那些事。那是在肯特瀑布，1900-1906年，第一座Submachine在1900年之前被更早建造。那就是我所全部知道的了。这个古老的地点是后来用时间机器建造的。（我指Sub0）它是在第一台Submachine之后很久制造的。从建设者的角度来看，我们当然可以采取其他什么观点？…历史？有了时间机器，历史的意义就不复存在了…关于Sub4的古代部分的雕像，这可能是墨菲的真实面貌，我认为它更具象征意义。有人触发了Submachine的自发性的创造。在Submachine被发明之后，它开始自己扩展，所以在开始的时候有一个人为因素。

A scientist in the early 1900s discovered and created a new technology which he named Submachine. This discovery and invention exists within or rather shares many of the laws of physics but in a space below that of normal physical reality. Subphysical. The Submachine exists in a space within space or rather in parallel. A Subworld or Underworld (this is important). While experimenting with his Submachines he made a mistake as no one could possibly understand the full scope of such new technology, nor where the boundaries of normal physics lay. Through the creation of a submachine he was (intentionally or otherwise) transported through time. On exiting this underworld he found himself in ancient Egyptian times. An early 20th century scientist with absolute knowledge of the 'Underworld'. Now to anyone who finds themselves in a foreign land by accident, first priority is 'How do I get home?'. If this proves to be impossible your new priority is 'How am I going to survive?'. If you are a 20th century scientist in Egypt, with knowledge of the underworld and the ability to take someone and show them part of that underworld. Then you have got survival conquered.

20世纪初，一位科学家发现并创造了一种新技术，他将其命名为“Submachine”。这一发现和发明更确切地说基于许多物理定律的共性，但存在于正常物理现实之下的空间中。Sub物理下子机器存在于空间内的一个子空间中，或者更确切地说是平行的。Sub世界或地下世界（这很重要）。在科学家试验他的Submachine时，他犯了一个错误，因为没人能理解这种新技术，也没有人能理解正常物理的界限在哪。通过制造一个Submachine，他被（有意或无意地）通过时间运输。离开Sub世界后，他发现自己身处古埃及时代。作为20世纪初对“地下世界”有绝对了解的科学家，现在，成为了一个偶然发现自己身处异国他乡的人，第一要务将是“我怎么回家？”。如果做不到，你的新重点肯定是“我该怎么活下去？”如果你是一个在古埃及的20世纪的科学家，当你了解这个地下世界，并且有能力带别人去看他们是地下世界的一部分。接下来你就赢得了生存。

## Quote from Sub6

THOTH 

Patron of: knowledge, secrets, writing, and scribes. Appearance: A man with the head of an ibis holding a scribe's palette and stylus. He was also shown as a full ibis, or sometimes as baboon Description: Thoth is an unusual god. Though some stories place his as a son of Ra, other say that Thoth created himself  through the power of language. He is the create or magic, the inventor of writing, teacher of man, the messenger of the gods (and thus identified by the Greeks with Hermes) and the divine record-keeper and mediator. 
He was also a measurer and recorder of time.
A 20th century scientist from on ancient Egyptian perspective:
Patron of: knowledge, secrets, writing, and scribes. Check! 
He is the creator of magic, the inventor of writing, leacher of man, the messenger of the gods and the divine record-keeper and mediator. Check!
He was also a measurer and recorder of time. Check!
So we are left with a name, Thoth and his appearance.
Name first.
What if his name was say Tim Roth, he is in a strange land, the only known Tim, the only Roth. In a land where the written language is hieroglyphs. He simply becomes Thoth.

引用自Sub6的纸条

智慧之神Thoth

代表知识、秘密、写作和抄写员。

外貌：一个长着朱鹭头的男人拿着抄写员的板子和笔。

他的外貌也被描绘成一个完整的朱鹭，有时也可能是狒狒：Thoth是一个不寻常的神。虽然有些故事把他作为Ra（古埃及太阳神)之子，另一个说，Thoth创造了自己通过语言的力量。他是造物或魔法，写作的发明者。人的老师，神的使者（因此被希腊人和赫耳墨斯所认同），以及神的记录保管者和调解人。
他也是时间的测量者和记录者。

古埃及的20世纪科学家：

代表知识、秘密、写作和抄写员。Check！

他是魔法的创造者，写作的发明者，人类的浸出者，神的使者，神的记录保管者和调解人。Check！

他也是时间的测量者和记录者。Check！

所以我们只剩下一个名字，Thoth和他的外貌。

首先列出名字

如果他的名字叫Tim Roth，他在一个陌生的地方，唯一知道是Tim，唯一的Roth。在一个书写语言是象形文字的地方。他的名字只是变成了Thoth。

HIS APPEARANCE. 
A man with the head of on ibis holding a scribe's palette and stylus. He was also shown as a full ibis, or sometimes as baboon. He lives in ancient Egypt, he dies, his deeds and knowledge ore passed on through a few generations, he is venerated as a god, they depict him as they depict all their gods.So a 20th century scientist trapped in another time ingratiates himself with the powerful of the land but he still wants to go home. He builds Submachines (means unknown) and sets about protecting these Submachines with defences and in turn connects them in to a Subnet. This proto-Subnet he designs to adapt in the hope that it will find the means to take him home. It doesn`t. 'someone triggered spontaneous creation of submochines. After the 'invention' sub started to expand by itself. so there was a human factor in it at the beginning. but no more.' After his death the Subnet continues to evolve. Thousands of years pass. The scientist is born and creates Submochines BUT the Subnet we are exploring already exists, he created it in his future, our past. The Subnet still waits on him. In Sub 6, as we exit the mover, we are asked for on IDN (IDentification Number presumably). We do not know Thoth's IDN so we are dumped. This I hope explains the Egyptian emphasis on the Subnet.

他的外貌。

一个长着朱鹭头的人拿着抄写员的板和笔。他也被描绘成一个完整的朱鹭，或有时像狒狒。他生活在古埃及，他死了，他的行为和知识传承了几代人，他被尊为神，他们把他描绘成他们的一个神。
因此，一个20世纪的科学家被困在另一个时代，以那个时代的土地的力量讨好自己，但他仍然想回家。他建造了Submachines（表示未知），并着手用防御系统保护这些机器，然后将它们连接到Sub net。他设计的这个原型Sub net是为了适应这种情况，并且希望能找到带他回家的方法。但它没有，在“发明”Submachine开始自行扩张之后，有人触发了Submachine的自我创造。所以这里在开始的时候有一个人为因素。
他死后，Subnet继续进化。几千年过去了。科学家创造了Submachine，但是我们正在探索的Subnet已经存在，他在未来创造了它，即我们的过去。Subnet仍在等待他。在Sub 6中，当我们离开移动舱时，需要在IDN上（大概是识别号）找到我们。我们不知道Thoth的身份，所以我们被丢了出去。我希望这能解释埃及人对Subnet的重视。
