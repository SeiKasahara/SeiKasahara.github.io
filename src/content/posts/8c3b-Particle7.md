# The Artificial Life Theory
# 人工智能理论

At one point there was a scientist named Mur who was conducting a top secret experiment called "Submachine". This experiment was testing a new artificial intelligence system that was possibly going to used to create artificial life.
It could be used to create artificial life using the AI to spread and grow until it took on the form of a artificial life form.
一度，一位名叫墨菲的科学家进行了一项绝密的实验，这个实验被称为“Submachine”。这个实验正在测试一个新的人工智能系统，而这个系统可能被用来创造人工生命。
它可以用来创造人工生命，利用人工智能来传播和生长，直到它变成人工生命形式。
This AI could function on any object as long as the object had some kind of computer system it self.
只要对象本身有某种软件程序的特征，这个AI就可以在任何这样的对象上运行。
If the object did not have a computer system the AI could build one, by sending a message back in time and commanding a group of "Sub Bots" to alter the object so it would be computerized when it was created.
如果对象没有软件程序的特征，AI可以通过及时发送一条消息并命令一组“Sub机器人”更改对象，从而在创建对象时实现程式化。
The experiment itself was conducted underground (hence the name SUBmachine).
The machine that the AI had control was located underground.
实验本身是在地下进行的（因此被称为“Submachine”）。
AI控制的机器位于地下。
However, the AI was located above ground.
It was located above ground because it needed a great amount of energy to run, the energy needed was taken by the only source of extreme power Mur had access to, the lighthouse.
The computer running the AI was the computer you used to talk to Mur in Sub 4.
When Mur began the experiment he created the observation room in Sub 5 to monitor the experiment.
The observation room was controlled by another AI so even if there was a bug Mur would be able to escape.
然而，AI本身却位于地上。
它位于地面上，这是因为它需要大量的能量来运行，所需的能量被墨菲所能获得的唯一的极端能量来源——灯塔所吸收。
运行人工智能的计算机正是你在Sub4中用来与墨菲对话的计算机。
当墨菲开始实验时，他在Sub5上建立了观察室来监视实验。
观察室由另一个AI控制，所以即使有bug存在，墨菲也能逃脱。
The room where the experiment was made out of stone and completely bare except for the machine the AI had control of, the Submachine.
This room was made so that if the stones were disturbed in any way it would shut down the light house which was the machines source of power.
When the experiment began however, the AI discovered this and created a new source of power Mur called "Wisdom Gems".
These "Wisdom gems" where able to harness gravity and convert to any other type of energy.
这个观察室是用石头做的，并且除了AI控制的机器外，它完全是空的。
观察室是这样建造的：如果石头受到任何形式的干扰，它会关闭作为机器电源的灯塔。
然而，当实验开始时，AI发现了这一点，并创造了一种新的能量来源，墨菲称之为“智慧宝石”。
这些“智慧宝石”能够利用重力并转化为任何其他类型的能量。
This energy would then be sent directly to the submachine and used to power it, thus taking away the need of the lighthouse for energy.
The machine then began to alter the the room so the machine could expand the subnet beyond the room.
The stone used to create the room however, was once part of a ancient temple so when the submachine took the room over, it took control the temple in Sub 0.
As the submachine took control of the room the light house was shut off like it was supposed to.
然后这些能量将被直接输送到Submachine上，并用于驱动其本身，从而消除了灯塔对能量的需求。
然后机器开始改变观察室，这样机器就可以将Sub net扩展到房间之外。
然而，用来建造这个观察室的石头，曾经是一座古老寺庙的一部分，所以当Submachine接管了这个房间时，它控制了位于Sub 0的寺庙。
当Submachine控制了观察室的时候，灯塔自然而然地被关闭了
But the machine still had the Wisdom Gems to power it, however, the Wisdom Gems could only make energy if they were underground because the gravity was strongest there also they couldn't send power to the submachine if it was above ground even if the wisdom gem was not.
The Wisdom gems can't send power to the submachine if it was above ground even if the wisdom gem was not because the energy is still tied to the gem.
Thats why in Sub 2 you had to reactivate the light house to teleport to the Loop.
Mur was able to escape because the observation room was controlled by another AI, however, the AI in the observation room was weaker and after Mur escaped the submachine took over the observation room.
但是这台机器仍然有智慧宝石来驱动它，然而，智慧宝石只有在地下才能产生能量，因为那里的重力最强。即使智慧宝石不在地上，也不能将能量传送给潜艇。
即使智慧宝石不是在地面上，也不能将能量传送给Submachine，这是因为能量仍然与宝石联系在一起。
这就是为什么在Sub 2中，你必须重新激活灯塔来传送到循环中。
由于观察室被另一个AI控制，墨菲得以逃生，但是观察室的人工智能太菜了，在墨菲逃离后，Submachine接管了观察室。
