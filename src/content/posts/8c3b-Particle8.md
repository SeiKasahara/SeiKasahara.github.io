# Submachine Universe译稿3


# Karma Theory

# 业力理论

by: Pyro Dude

The subnet exists in a parallel dimension that is subtly different from our own. The laws of time and space don’t work in quite the same way, assuming the subnet’s dimension even follows the same laws of time and space. Submachines hang in the void yet there is gravity and breathable air. Objects can be instantaneously aged. Space can fold back on itself in strange ways. I think the underlying principle behind all of this is the idea of Karma energy.

Karma energy essentially is the dimension the subnet exists in. To call it energy is slightly inaccurate, as it is actually something else that while similar in function and use to the energy found in our universe, is more exotic in it’s nature. The subnet’s dimension is the source of Karma energy; it is found throughout the infinite void, and allows otherwise impossible manipulation of spacetime, as well as providing a huge amount of power. Karma energy seems to sometimes find its way to other realities, the flow of the energy forms connections between the two dimensions and allows travel between them. When concentrated enough, it can even pull entire buildings through to the subnet’s dimension.

subnet存在于一个平行维度中，与我们自己的维度有细微的不同。例如时间和空间定律的运作方式并不完全相同，假设Subnet的维度不遵循与本时空相同的时间和空间定律。潜艇悬挂在太空中，可是有重力以及可呼吸的空气。对象可以瞬间老化。空间可以以奇怪的方式自我折叠。我认为所有这些背后的基本原理是业力能量的概念。

业力能本质上是Subnet存在的维度。把其称之为能量并不准确，因为它实际上是另一种东西，虽然在功能和使用上与我们宇宙中发现的其他能量相似，但在它的本质上更为奇特。Subnet所处的维度是业力能的来源；它被发现于无限的虚空中，并且允许无法完成的时空操作，以及提供巨大的能量。业力能有时似乎找到了通往其他实空间的途径，能量的流动形成了两个维度之间的连接，并允许旅行于它们之间。当足够集中的时候，它甚至可以把整个空间构架拉到subnet的维度里。

Karma energy seems to have some connection with living beings. Mur came into contact with an usually high concentration of Karma energy on Earth in the accident that lost him his arm. It changed him, and gave him the ability to manipulate Karma energy at will. Quite possibly, his arm was transformed into pure Karma energy that retained a connection to Mur. It also seems possible that similarly, in the subnet, when people die they are disintegrated into pure Karma energy; evidenced by the lack of dead bodies next to notes that apparently describe the last words of some of the explorers. It could also be the reason for the amnesia in humans, due to the disruption of electrical impulses in the mind due to the surrounding Karma energy.

业力能似乎与生命有某种联系。在（肯特瀑布）失去手臂的事故中，墨菲接触到了地球上很高浓度的业力能。这种能量改变了他，并赋予他随意操纵业力能量的能力。很有可能，他的手臂被转化为纯粹的业力能量，却保持了与墨菲联系。同样，在subnet中，当人们死亡时，他们也可能被分解成纯粹的业力能量；这一点可以证明，在笔记旁没有尸体，很多笔记也显然描述了一些探险者的最后一句话。这同时可能是人类失忆的原因，因为周围的业力能导致大脑中的生物电信号中断。

In my opinion, the mechanism behind all the oddities of the subnet seems to be a resonance effect that Karma energy feels with itself. For instance, when two portal devices are activated: the first device energises specific characteristics of the Karma energy that determines it’s spatial co-ordinates. This causes the energy at the device and the energy at the receiving end co-ordinates to feel resonance with each other. The portal device at the other end then activates and energises the Karma energy at it’s end, allowing the flow of Karma energy and the transportation of objects and people.

在我看来，Subnet中所有奇怪事物背后的机制似乎是业力能自身的共振效应。例如，当两个传送门被激活时：第一个传送门激活决定其空间坐标的业力能的特征。这可以使得装置的能量和接收端的能量相互协调，产生共振。另一端的传送门随后激活并激发其端的业力能，允许业力能的流动以及物体和人在其中的运输。

The wisdom gems are artificial constructs that provide a concentrated source of Karma energy. The natural Karma energy of the void isn’t densely packed enough to provide much power, so the wisdom gems were created to harness it’s potential by brining together a large amount of Karma energy in a constrained and more organised and controllable form. Perhaps the subnet was created to collect or use this unique form of energy, though for what reason I’m not sure. 

I want to test this theory out, I’m sure there are ways I could experiment with the energy of the void. I have all these plans for apparatus, all these ideas in my head but when I try to construct them, I feel myself… slowly forgetting all of it. I’m left with sketches and vague thoughts with no idea of what their purposes are. I think these ideas may be the end of me. So obsessed with testing that eventually… perhaps I forget to eat or sleep. I don’t think I’m getting out of here.

智慧宝石是提供业力能量集中来源的人工产品。虚空的自然业力能量并没有足够的密度来提供足够的能量，所以智慧宝石被创造来集中并利用它，将大量的业力能量以一种受限的、更具组织性和可控性的形式结合在一起。也许创建Subnet是为了收集或使用这种独特的能量形式，但我不确定是什么原因。

“我想检验一下这个理论，我确信有一些方法可以用虚空中的能量进行实验。我对组织有着安排，所有这些想法其实都在我的头脑中，但是当我试图构建它们时，我感觉自己……慢慢地忘记了所有这些。我只剩下草图和模糊的想法，却不知道它们的目的是什么。我想这些想法可能将是终结。如此痴迷于测试，最终…也许我忘记了吃饭或睡觉。我想我不会离开这里。”
